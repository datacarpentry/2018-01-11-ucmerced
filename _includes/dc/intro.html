  <a href="{{site.dc_site}}">Data Carpentry</a>
  aims to help researchers work effectively and reproducibly with data
  by teaching them foundational research computing skills. This is a pilot Data Carpentry workshop with new curriculum on the Jupyter notebook.
</p>
<p>
In this workshop you will learn how to use the Jupyter notebook as a tool 
for good practices in reproducible research. Jupyter notebooks are 
increasingly widely adopted, and have been the main method of displaying 
detailed results in a number of high-profile scientific papers. As a tool 
promoting reproducible practices, Jupyter notebooks allow users to interleave 
text, code, and output into a single, interactive document that includes 
features facilitating research exploration, interactive learning, and 
sharing over the internet. Their dynamic nature is ideally suited to 
sharing all steps of the research workflow in a reproducible manner.

<p>
  Participants will be encouraged to help one 
  another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
